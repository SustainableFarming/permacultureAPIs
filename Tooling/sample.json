Tolerates soils with low fertility, but not in successive years. Commercial varieties of sesame require 90 to 120 frost-free days. Good drainage is very important. Most varieties are divided into shattering and non-shattering categories.",

They are commonly roasted, ground into flour, made into the paste \"tahini\" and are included in a large number of both sweet and savory food products. The leaves are sometimes smoked as a tobacco substitute. The stem ash is high in minerals and can be used as a nutritional salt. The leaves can be eaten raw or cooked. 70% of sesame yields go towards the production of sesame oil. It is a highly stable oil that resists rancidity due to its antioxidant content. It is eaten raw and for cooking and flavoring."
